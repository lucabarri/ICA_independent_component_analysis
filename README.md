# ICA - Independent Component Analysis
In this project, we apply the approach demonstrated by D. Back et al. 1997 in "A First Application of Independent Component Analysis to Extracting Structure from Stock Returns" to data from the French stock market between 02.01.2001 and 09.03.2010. We aim to understand how Independent Component Analysis (ICA) captures the structure of stock returns.

This project is part of the course *Allocation d'actifs et arbitrage multi-asset* from Professor Jean-Gabriel Attali. The project was done by Luca Barriviera and Carl-Emil Krarup Jensen.
